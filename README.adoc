= World of Warcraft addon builder

Library and command-line utility for creating a zip file for a World of
Warcraft addon based on `.pkgmeta` files used by WowAce/CurseForge.

Usage:

[source,shell]
----
# Install:
$ go get -u github.com/csmith/makeaddon/cmd/makeaddon

# Build an addon:
$ cd path/to/addon
$ makeaddon
$ ls -l addon.zip
----

Current issues:

- Specifying a tag of "latest" should check out the latest tag, but currently checks out the
  latest version (i.e., `master` for git repos).
- CurseForge replaces tokens in text files as documented in their
  https://authors.curseforge.com/knowledge-base/projects/3451-automatic-packaging[knowledge base].
  makeaddon does not yet perform these substitutions.
